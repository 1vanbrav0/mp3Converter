# mp3converter
Description: a responsive web application to download youtube videos into mp3 format. Just a school project.

Technologies used:

- HTML.
- CSS.
- AJAX.
- JS.
- NODEJS.
- EXPRESS.
- EJS (Templates engine).

Extra modules used:

- fluent-ffmpeg.

Final note: the project its done, its not perfect, but it do what it should do, i found problems like:

- Responsive design fails in higher resolutions than 1440p.
- There are not any http error screen.
- The mp3 downloaded dont have cover.

I trust that i can fix it but i prefer fix that issues in future projects than in this.
